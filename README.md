## Setup on host

### Environment

Add the following environment variable to your system, for example within `~/.bashrc` or  `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
export USER_ID=$(id -u)
export GROUP_ID=$(id -g)
```

### Mount points

Creates every file which gets mounted into the php container (shell rc/history, git, ssh and the coding agent
auth/settings files) without overwriting existing ones. Adjust the seeded settings files afterwards to your
liking, they stay on the host and get mounted.

```sh
./setup-mount-points.sh
```

### Coding agents

The following coding agents (harnesses) are preinstalled within the php container, their auth and settings files
get mounted from the host (see `docker-compose.yml`):

 * [Claude Code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code): `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`
 * [Codex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openai/codex): `~/.codex/auth.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`
 * [Opencode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-ai): `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`, `~/.config/opencode/tui.json`, `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`
 * [PI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) incl. [pi-llama](https://github.com/huggingface/pi-llama): `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`

#### llama.cpp

PI can run against a local model via [pi-llama](https://github.com/huggingface/pi-llama), start a
[llama.cpp](https://llama.app/) server on the host, for example:

```sh
llama-server \
    -hf lmstudio-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:Q4_K_M \
    -c 32768 \
    -ngl 999 \
    --flash-attn on \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 9931
```

### Docker

```sh
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec php bash
```
